# Blast Mainnet Subgraph Example

This is an example subgraph for Blast Mainnet. It's simply the ERC721 subgraph from [OpenZeppelin Subgraphs](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-subgraphs).

Important piece is the `network` in [subgraph.yaml#7](./subgraph.yaml#7): It's set to: `blast-mainnet`. Otherwise, the subgraph is normal. See the official [Quick Start on thegraph.com](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/quick-start/).
